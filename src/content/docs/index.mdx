## What is StarVLA?

StarVLA is a modular and flexible codebase for developing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Each component (model, data, trainer, configuration, evaluation) is designed for high cohesion and low coupling, enabling plug-and-play research and fast iteration.
