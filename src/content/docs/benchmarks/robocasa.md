title: RoboCasa Evaluation
description: Reproduce StarVLA experimental results on RoboCasa GR1 Tabletop Tasks.
---

This document provides instructions for reproducing our **experimental results** with [RoboCasa GR1 Tabletop Tasks](https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa-gr1-tabletop-tasks).

The evaluation process consists of two main parts:

1. Setting up the `robocasa` environment and dependencies.
2. Running the evaluation by launching services in both `starVLA` and `robocasa` environments.

We have verified that this workflow runs successfully on **NVIDIA A100** GPUs.

## RoboCasa Evaluation

### 0. Download Checkpoints

First, download the checkpoints from:
- [Qwen3VL-GR00T](https://huggingface.co/StarVLA/Qwen3-VL-GR00T-Robocasa-gr1)
- [Qwen3VL-OFT](https://huggingface.co/StarVLA/Qwen3-VL-OFT-Robocasa)

### 1. Environment Setup

To set up the environment, please first follow the [official RoboCasa installation guide](https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa-gr1-tabletop-tasks?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to install the base `robocasa-gr1-tabletop-tasks` environment.

Then install socket support:

```bash
pip install tyro
```

---

### 2. Evaluation Workflow

#### Step 1. Start the server (starVLA environment)

In the first terminal, activate the `starVLA` conda environment and run:

```bash
python deployment/model_server/server_policy.py \
        --ckpt_path ${your_ckpt} \
        --port 5678 \
        --use_bf16
```

---

#### Step 2. Start the simulation (robocasa environment)

In the second terminal, activate the `robocasa` conda environment and run:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):${PYTHONPATH}
your_ckpt=StarVLA/Qwen3-VL-OFT-Robocasa/checkpoints/steps_90000_pytorch_model.pt

python examples/Robocasa_tabletop/eval_files/simulation_env.py\
   --args.env_name ${env_name} \
   --args.port 5678 \
   --args.n_episodes 50 \
   --args.n_envs 1 \
   --args.max_episode_steps 720 \
   --args.n_action_steps 12 \
   --args.video_out_path ${video_out_path} \
   --args.pretrained_path ${your_ckpt}
```

#### Batch Evaluation (Optional)

If you have more GPUs, you can use the batch evaluation script:

```bash
bash examples/Robocasa_tabletop/batch_eval_args.sh
```

**Note:** Please ensure that you specify the correct checkpoint path in `batch_eval_args.sh`

---

## Reproduce Training Results

### Step 0: Download the training dataset

Download the PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-X-Embodiment-Sim directory datasets from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-X-Embodiment-Sim) to the `playground/Datasets/nvidia/PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-X-Embodiment-Sim` directory.

To download only the relevant finetuning folders, you can refer to [GR00T-N1.5](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T/tree/4af2b622892f7dcb5aae5a3fb70bcb02dc217b96/examples/RoboCasa#-1-dataset-preparation) repo's instruction.

Or use the script to download the `*_1000` folders:

```bash
python examples/Robocasa_tabletop/download_gr00t_ft_data.py
```

### Step 1: Start Training

Different datasets can be selected by modifying the parameter `data_mix`, and the following script can be used to fine-tune the `*_1000` datasets:

```bash
bash examples/Robocasa_tabletop/train_files/run_robocasa.sh
```
