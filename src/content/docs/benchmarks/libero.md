title: LIBERO Evaluation
description: Reproduce StarVLA experimental results on LIBERO (setup, evaluation workflow, and training notes).
---

This document provides instructions for reproducing our **experimental results** with LIBERO.
The evaluation process consists of two main parts:

1. Setting up the `LIBERO` environment and dependencies.
2. Running the evaluation by launching services in both `starVLA` and `LIBERO` environments.

We have verified that this workflow runs successfully on both **NVIDIA A100** and **RTX 4090** GPUs.

## LIBERO Evaluation

### 0. Download Checkpoints

We provide a collection of pretrained checkpoints on Hugging Face to make community evaluation easier: [🤗 StarVLA/bench-libero](https://huggingface.co/collections/StarVLA/libero). Their corresponding results on LIBERO are summarized in the table below.

#### Experimental Results

| Model                | Steps | Epochs | Spatial | Object | Goal | Long | Avg  |
|----------------------|-------|--------|---------|--------|------|------|------|
| $\pi_0$+FAST         | -     | -      | 96.4    | 96.8   | 88.6 | 60.2 | 85.5 |
| OpenVLA-OFT          | 175K  | 223    | 97.6    | 98.4   | 97.9 | 94.5 | 97.1 |

We train one policy for all 4 suites. All scores are averaged over 500 trials for each task suite (10 tasks × 50 episodes).

### 1. Environment Setup

To set up the environment, please first follow the official [LIBERO repository](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO) to install the base `LIBERO` environment.

⚠️ **Common issue:** LIBERO defaults to Python 3.8, but the syntax updates between 3.8 and 3.10 are substantial. **We verified that using Python 3.10 avoids many issues**.

Afterwards, inside the `LIBERO` environment, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install tyro matplotlib mediapy websockets msgpack
pip install numpy==1.24.4
```

---

### 2. Evaluation Workflow

Run the evaluation **from the starVLA repository root** using **two separate terminals**, one for each environment:

- **starVLA environment**: runs the inference server.
- **LIBERO environment**: runs the simulation.

#### Step 1. Start the server (starVLA environment)

In the first terminal, activate the `starVLA` conda environment and run:

```bash
bash examples/LIBERO/eval_files/run_policy_server.sh
```

⚠️ **Note:** Please ensure that you specify the correct checkpoint path in `examples/LIBERO/eval_files/run_policy_server.sh`

---

#### Step 2. Start the simulation (LIBERO environment)

In the second terminal, activate the `LIBERO` conda environment and run:

```bash
bash examples/LIBERO/eval_files/eval_libero.sh
```

⚠️ **Note:** Please ensure that you specify the correct checkpoint path in `eval_libero.sh` to load action unnormalization stats.

Also ensure the environment variables at the top of `eval_libero.sh` are correctly set.

Finally, each result will also save a video for visualization, as shown below:

## LIBERO Training

### Step 0: Download the training dataset

Download the datasets to the `playground/Datasets/LEROBOT_LIBERO_DATA` directory:

- [LIBERO-spatial](https://huggingface.co/datasets/IPEC-COMMUNITY/libero_spatial_no_noops_1.0.0_lerobot)
- [LIBERO-object](https://huggingface.co/datasets/IPEC-COMMUNITY/libero_object_no_noops_1.0.0_lerobot)
- [LIBERO-goal](https://huggingface.co/datasets/IPEC-COMMUNITY/libero_goal_no_noops_1.0.0_lerobot)
- [LIBERO-10](https://huggingface.co/datasets/IPEC-COMMUNITY/libero_10_no_noops_1.0.0_lerobot)

And move `modality.json` to each `$LEROBOT_LIBERO_DATA/subset/meta/modality.json`.

You could quickly prepare these by running:

```bash
# Set DEST to the directory where you want to store the data
export DEST=/path/to/your/data/directory
bash examples/LIBERO/data_preparation.sh
```

### Step 1: Start Training

Most of the required training files have been organized in `examples/LIBERO/train_files/`.

Run the following command to start training:

```bash
bash examples/LIBERO/train_files/run_libero_train.sh
```

⚠️ **Note:** Please ensure that you specify the correct path in `examples/LIBERO/train_files/run_libero_train.sh`
